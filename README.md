# mantra

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/mantra/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/mantra)

A ClojureScript library designed to make it easy to create music using the HTML5 Web Audio API. Mantra is similar in motivation to [Hum](https://github.com/mathias/hum), but aims to abstract away the lower-level implementation details and provide a higher-level API.
